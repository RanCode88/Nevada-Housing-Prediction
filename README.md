# Nevada-Housing-Prediction
- Hi everyone, this is my first data science project I uploaded on the Github. I got inspired by a data scientist called Jose Portilla, and I gradually discovered my passion about data visualization and modeling prediction. This project I made my prediction with Nevada housing price factors with Linear Regression model. 
- The dataset is not real, it is madeup. But it is very interesting to practice and experiment on it. Jose actually made a really good demonstration for me, and I edited and explored a little more about the model.
